PROBLEM STATEMENT:create a console-based game of Hangman where a player guesses letters to find a hidden word. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses, and the program should track their progress, reveal correct letters, and determine if the player wins or loses. 

SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT:The scope is to create a fully operational, console-based version of Hangman using only the core Python language and standard libraries.The scope of this Python Hangman project is narrow, focused, and educational, aiming to successfully implement the core logic of the classic word-guessing game.

TARGET USERS:The primary target users for this Hangman Python project fall into two main categories: Learners and Casual Users.Python Learners and Students represent the most significant target audience, as the project's simple yet comprehensive scope makes it an excellent teaching tool.

HIGH LEVEL FEATURES: 1. Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) Gameplay
                        The project provides a complete, interactive, and self-contained game experience directly through the user's terminal or command prompt.

                     2. Dynamic Visual Feedback and State Tracking
                       The project excels at clearly communicating the current game state to the player using text-based graphics and variables.
                       
                    3. Modular and Robust Data Handling
                       The project incorporates key data management features essential for a flexible and maintainable application.
